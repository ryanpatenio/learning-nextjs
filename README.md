## üß† Notes & Learnings
--
# Day 1
- in next js routing the name it must be pages and layout @example if i will create new dir Dashboard/page.jsx it must be inside this folder is Page otherwise next would not recognize it and it will shows 404
- & if you put a layout.jsx inside in that folder that dashboard page will use  that layout inside that you set
- if you want to create another folder inside the dashboard if you want to access it you must put @example localhost::3000/dashboard/user the [user] is the name of that folder
- to avoid browser request using a tags you must use the Link of next js just like the inertia with has a param of href and you can also use className inside
- @use server and @use client @more strict
- use server only use in server while the use client is only in the client this involve the react hooks that only use in client
- 
# Day 2
- (auth) by using this in folder it will skip the dir auth and the dir will be the same as register this will helps when you have multi folder structure
- useActionState - this state is from react then it has 3 [state,action,isPending] = useStateAction(register,undefined)
- action is where you put in the form tags action ={action}
- then the register in the first param in the actionState is a function name in the actions server
- isPending is a boolean, when you submit a form the isPending will be true and after you submit it will be back false after submission
- by using the react hooks useActionState it will get an error if you dont put a [use client] in that page or file coz you can only use react hooks in the client only
- then in the server you must put ['user server'] on the top that will all the function must be run in the server only not in the client
- when using "user server" in the server action you must put all function into async coz it all function in the server must be asynchronous and you must wait the server

# @form Validation with package zod
- installing zod package [npm i zod] in the terminal
- create a folder lib in src/lib then you can create rules.js there or rules.ts for typescript
- you can create a registerFormSchema for validation of the register form
- to make it clear just read the docs of zod validations https://zod.dev/basics
- console.log(validatedFields) //if we use this the validated not success will except a getter thats why se use validatedFields.error.flatten.fieldErrors to convert it into text in a array
- in the useStateAction when submitting the form the [state] is the state of the form then you can grab the errors you set in your rules
- in that state you can grab errors or data that you set to return in the client side like when it got an error you can return the old email and grab that using the state of useStateAction of react
