## 🧠 Notes & Learnings
- in next js routing the name it must be pages and layout @example if i will create new dir Dashboard/page.jsx it must be inside this folder is Page otherwise next would not recognize it and it will shows 404
- & if you put a layout.jsx inside in that folder that dashboard page will use  that layout inside that you set
- if you want to create another folder inside the dashboard if you want to access it you must put @example localhost::3000/dashboard/user the [user] is the name of that folder
- to avoid browser request using a tags you must use the Link of next js just like the inertia with has a param of href and you can also use className inside
